      <p>Big Jay is the mascot for the University of Kansas. Though he is portrayed as a bird, the jayhawk is actually based on the abolitionists from Kansas that called themselves Jayhawkers. Nonetheless,
      Big Jay stands tall (at least 6 feet) at all Kansas Athletics events to cheer on the athletes. Unlike most birds, big jay cannot fly, likely because his wings are too small (just look at them, come on).
      He wears jersey #1, as you can see in the picture, but records indicate that he has never actually played for Kansas in any sport. Maybe once he learns to fly, he'll get a spot on a team.</p>
